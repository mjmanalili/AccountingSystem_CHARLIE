### Hi there! Mj Manalili here.ðŸ‘‹
I am a Certified Public Accountant and self-taught Python programmer. I just started learning this March 2020 because this corona pandemic gave me so much time to study new things like this one.
As of this writing, I made a few projects but my most achievement so far is the Accounting and Finance System that I made for my present company.
It's currently being used and it made a lot of manual processes easier and faster. I also make it a point to update and shorten my codes to make it more readable, cleaner and faster.

Right now, I am into Unity game development. I am trying to understand how to use it and hopefully make a simple game out of it. By learning Unity, I also study programming using C#.

I'm looking to collaborate with other programmers here and eventually make a start-up and earn money for a living.

You can ask me about my journey to becoming a Python programmer and accountant.

You can reach me at mjmanalilicpa@gmail.com

I love making games and computer programs.

Yeah! Peace!
